## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project investigates how different deep learning architectures perform when fine-tuned on the Stanford Car dataset. Models are evaluated based on:

- Classification accuracy  
- Training convergence speed  
- Computational efficiency

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
**How do different deep learning architectures (custom CNN, MobileNet V2, and SmolVLM) compare when fine-tuned on the Stanford Car dataset?**

### Secondary Objectives
- Evaluate model performance across multiple metrics.
- Determine if transfer learning significantly outperforms models trained from scratch.
